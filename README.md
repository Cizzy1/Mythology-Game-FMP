# Mythology-Game-FMP
FMP practical files project

Final major project GitHub page. This has been made for better management of the game across mulitple devices. It helps me do work 
at home and in college without having a version out of date. It also keeps me from exporting and re importing unity packages 
(Which takes up a lot of space towards the end of the project).
